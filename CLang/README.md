# C_Language_Notes

This is a Private Repo for myself as I am learning the C Language following the Youtube video by Bro Code

Video could be accessed by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xND0t1pr3KY&list=LL

~Currently no planning to make it public.
Just for codes transmission easily.~

Making it public for others to learn. Enjoy
